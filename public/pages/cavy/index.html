<h1>Favourite Places in Toronto</h1>
<p>As a city opossum, I love exploring all the nooks and crannies of Toronto. Some of my favourite places to hang out include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Toronto Islands</li>
<li>High Park</li>
<li>The Don Valley</li>
<li>The Leslie Spit</li>
</ul>
<p>These places are great for foraging for food, exploring new terrain, and enjoying the natural beauty of the city.</p>
