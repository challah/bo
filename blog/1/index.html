<p><h3><a href="/bo/blog/hodo_kwaja/" class="collection-heading">Hodo Kwaja's Walnut Cakes and Hotteok â€“ A Perfect Toronto Koreatown Treat</a></h3>
<p>February 15th, 2023</p>
<p><p>Opossums, gather around because I have discovered the tastiest treats in Toronto's Koreatown! Today, I have some exciting news to share with you all. I've stumbled upon some scrumptious leftovers in Christie Pits, right from the legendary Hodo Kwaja bakery in Toronto's Koreatown!</p></p>
<p><strong>Walnut Cakes</strong> First up, I tried their famous walnut cakes. These small, round pastries are filled with sweet red bean paste and a walnut piece. The cakes are soft, warm, and have a lovely aroma. The red bean paste is just the right level of sweetness, and the walnut adds a satisfying crunch. I'll give these walnut cakes a solid 9 out of 10! ðŸŒŸ</p>
<p><strong>Hotteok</strong> Next, I tried their hotteok, a Korean-style pancake filled with brown sugar, honey, and crushed peanuts. The hotteok is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, with a gooey, sweet filling. It's the perfect blend of textures! The sweetness of the brown sugar and honey contrasts nicely with the savory pancake, making for a mouth-watering experience. Hotteok gets a 10 out of 10 from me! ðŸŒŸ</p>
<p>My middle child, Bojangles, was captivated by the hotteok. She commented, &quot;The crispy and chewy texture makes this treat irresistible! I can't wait to find more.&quot;</p>
<p>I am truly grateful for these delightful leftover treasures from Hodo Kwaja. Stay tuned for more of my culinary escapades!</p>
