<p><h3><a href="/bo/blog/poutine/" class="collection-heading">Late-Night Poutine: A Garbage Can Delight</a></h3>
<p>April 12th, 2023</p>
<p><img src="/bo/images/poutine.png" alt="poutine in a dark alleyway"></p>
<p>Hey fellow opossums! üåô It's your favourite nocturnal foodie here, sharing my thoughts on a popular late-night snack in Toronto: <strong>Poutine</strong>.</p>
<p>Just the other night, I happened upon an open garbage can behind a bustling downtown restaurant. To my delight, I found some leftover poutine, a Canadian dish made of fries, cheese curds, and delicious gravy.</p>
<p>The fries were a bit soggy, but that's how I like 'em. The cheese curds were still fresh, providing that satisfying squeaky texture we all know and love. The gravy was a bit cold but had a rich flavour that brought the whole dish together.</p>
<p>Overall, I'd give this late-night garbage can poutine a solid <strong>7 out of 10</strong>. It's a scrumptious snack for any urban opossum on the go. Just remember to wash your paws after indulging in this savory treat!</p>
<p>All my children joined me to share the delicious find. They all had different opinions on the dish, but they agreed that the cheese curds were the star of the show.</p>
<p>Until next time, stay safe and happy foraging! üêæ</p>

<p><h3><a href="/bo/blog/koreatown/" class="collection-heading">A Korean Feast From Green Bins in Toronto's Koreatown</a></h3>
<p>March 5th, 2023</p>
<p><p>I had a hankering for some authentic Korean cuisine, so I decided to pay a visit to Koreatown. After scoping out some green bins behind some popular restaurants, I hit the jackpot and found a veritable Korean feast!</p></p>
<p>One green bin was filled with various banchan (side dishes), including spicy kimchi, sweet and sour pickled radish, and seasoned bean sprouts. These banchan were so flavourful, and the combination of textures made each bite a joy. Banchan score: 8 out of 10! üåü</p>
<p>I also found some japchae (stir-fried glass noodles with vegetables) in another green bin. The noodles were slightly chewy and perfectly seasoned, while the vegetables added a nice crunch. It was an excellent mix of flavours, earning a 9 out of 10! üåü</p>
<p>The pi√®ce de r√©sistance was the bulgogi (marinated beef slices). The meat was tender and packed with a rich, savory flavor. It had the perfect balance of sweetness and soy sauce, making it an utterly delectable dish. Bulgogi score: 10 out of 10! üåü</p>
<p>Bogart, my second youngest, joined me for the Korean feast, and he couldn't get enough of the bulgogi. &quot;The tender beef and savoury flavors are amazing! I'll be dreaming about this for days,&quot; he remarked.</p>
<p>All in all, this green bin feast was an incredible find. Koreatown never disappoints!</p>

<p><h3><a href="/bo/blog/hodo_kwaja/" class="collection-heading">Hodo Kwaja's Walnut Cakes and Hotteok ‚Äì A Perfect Toronto Koreatown Treat</a></h3>
<p>February 15th, 2023</p>
<p><p>Opossums, gather around because I have discovered the tastiest treats in Toronto's Koreatown! Today, I have some exciting news to share with you all. I've stumbled upon some scrumptious leftovers in Christie Pits, right from the legendary Hodo Kwaja bakery in Toronto's Koreatown!</p></p>
<p><strong>Walnut Cakes</strong> First up, I tried their famous walnut cakes. These small, round pastries are filled with sweet red bean paste and a walnut piece. The cakes are soft, warm, and have a lovely aroma. The red bean paste is just the right level of sweetness, and the walnut adds a satisfying crunch. I'll give these walnut cakes a solid 9 out of 10! üåü</p>
<p><strong>Hotteok</strong> Next, I tried their hotteok, a Korean-style pancake filled with brown sugar, honey, and crushed peanuts. The hotteok is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, with a gooey, sweet filling. It's the perfect blend of textures! The sweetness of the brown sugar and honey contrasts nicely with the savory pancake, making for a mouth-watering experience. Hotteok gets a 10 out of 10 from me! üåü</p>
<p>My middle child, Bojangles, was captivated by the hotteok. She commented, &quot;The crispy and chewy texture makes this treat irresistible! I can't wait to find more.&quot;</p>
<p>I am truly grateful for these delightful leftover treasures from Hodo Kwaja. Stay tuned for more of my culinary escapades!</p>
