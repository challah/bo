<p><img src="/bo/images/fruit_salad.png" alt="discarded bowl of fruit salad"></p>
<p>Hello, opossum buddies! üçì Today, I bring you a review of a delightful and nutritious find: <strong>Fruit Salad</strong>.</p>
<p>While scurrying around the streets of Toronto, I discovered a small container of fruit salad that had been accidentally left on a bench. The colorful medley of fruits instantly caught my eye, and I knew I had to give it a try.</p>
<p>The fruit salad contained a mix of strawberries, blueberries, pineapple, and grapes. Each fruit was juicy and flavorful, providing a wonderful combination of sweet and tangy tastes. The pineapple, in particular, was a standout favorite, with its bright and tropical flavor.</p>
<p>As a bonus, this fruit salad was also an excellent source of vitamins and nutrients, making it a healthy choice for opossums looking to balance out their diet.</p>
<p>Bongo, my second eldest, couldn't resist the spicy Indian food he found nearby, but he took a moment to try the fruit salad. &quot;I love how the pineapple adds a tangy twist to the mix!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>I'd give this fruit salad find a refreshing <strong>8.5 out of 10</strong>. It's a fantastic option for opossums seeking a sweet and nutritious treat on their urban food hunts.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more foodie adventures, and remember: variety is the spice of life! üçáüççüêæ</p>

<p><h3><a href="/bo/blog/pizza/" class="collection-heading">Pizza Crust Paradise: A Savory Surprise</a></h3>
<p>August 15th, 2023</p>
<p><img src="/bo/images/pizza_crusts.png" alt="box of pizza crusts"></p>
<p>Greetings, fellow opossums! üåô I'm back with another food adventure, and this time, we're diving into the world of <strong>Pizza Crusts</strong>.</p>
<p>Late one evening, I stumbled upon a discarded pizza box in a park near a lively Toronto pizzeria. To my delight, the box contained several uneaten pizza crusts, just waiting to be devoured!</p>
<p>The crusts were a bit chewy, but they had a wonderful yeasty aroma that I simply couldn't resist. Some of the crusts even had bits of tomato sauce and cheese still clinging to them, providing an extra burst of flavor.</p>
<p>I especially appreciated the variety of crust thicknesses: some were thin and crispy, while others were thick and doughy, offering a diverse range of textures for my taste buds to explore.</p>
<p>Bol√©, my youngest, was thrilled to join me for the pizza crust adventure. &quot;I love how the thicker crusts are doughy and comforting. Pizza crusts are my new favorite!&quot; she declared.</p>
<p>I'd rate this pizza crust find a scrumptious <strong>9 out of 10</strong>. It's a perfect late-night snack for any opossum looking to satisfy their carb cravings.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled for more tasty discoveries, and stay safe out there, friends! üêæ</p>

<p><h3><a href="/bo/blog/bagel/" class="collection-heading">The Marvelous World of Bagel Crumbs</a></h3>
<p>June 3rd, 2023</p>
<p><img src="/bo/images/bagel.png" alt="bagel crumbs"></p>
<p>Hello, my opossum friends! ‚òÄÔ∏è Today, I'll be talking about a delightful breakfast find: <strong>Bagel Crumbs</strong>.</p>
<p>I ventured into a charming alleyway near a bakery in Toronto's Kensington Market. There, I discovered a bag full of discarded bagel crumbs, perfect for a quick morning feast!</p>
<p>The crumbs came in a variety of flavors: plain, sesame, and even cinnamon raisin! I enjoyed the plain crumbs the most, as they provided a simple yet satisfying taste. The sesame crumbs had a delightful crunch and a pleasant nutty flavor. The cinnamon raisin crumbs were a bit too sweet for my liking, but I appreciated the touch of variety.</p>
<p>Bingo, my eldest, accompanied me on this adventure and eagerly nibbled on the sesame bagel crumbs. He chimed in, &quot;These are the perfect balance of crunch and chewiness, just the way I like it!&quot;</p>
<p>Given the assortment of flavors and the sheer volume of crumbs, I'd rate this bagel crumb find a solid <strong>8 out of 10</strong>. It's a fantastic breakfast option for the discerning urban opossum.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more food adventures, and remember to always look on the bright side of life! üåûüêæ</p>

<p><h3><a href="/bo/blog/poutine/" class="collection-heading">Late-Night Poutine: A Garbage Can Delight</a></h3>
<p>April 12th, 2023</p>
<p><img src="/bo/images/poutine.png" alt="poutine in a dark alleyway"></p>
<p>Hey fellow opossums! üåô It's your favorite nocturnal foodie here, sharing my thoughts on a popular late-night snack in Toronto: <strong>Poutine</strong>.</p>
<p>Just the other night, I happened upon an open garbage can behind a bustling downtown restaurant. To my delight, I found some leftover poutine, a Canadian dish made of fries, cheese curds, and delicious gravy.</p>
<p>The fries were a bit soggy, but that's how I like 'em. The cheese curds were still fresh, providing that satisfying squeaky texture we all know and love. The gravy was a bit cold but had a rich flavor that brought the whole dish together.</p>
<p>Overall, I'd give this late-night garbage can poutine a solid <strong>7 out of 10</strong>. It's a scrumptious snack for any urban opossum on the go. Just remember to wash your paws after indulging in this savory treat!</p>
<p>All my children joined me to share the delicious find. They all had different opinions on the dish, but they agreed that the cheese curds were the star of the show.</p>
<p>Until next time, stay safe and happy foraging! üêæ</p>

<p><h3><a href="/bo/blog/koreatown/" class="collection-heading">A Korean Feast From Green Bins in Toronto's Koreatown</a></h3>
<p>March 5th, 2023</p>
<p><p>I had a hankering for some authentic Korean cuisine, so I decided to pay a visit to Koreatown. After scoping out some green bins behind some popular restaurants, I hit the jackpot and found a veritable Korean feast!</p></p>
<p>One green bin was filled with various banchan (side dishes), including spicy kimchi, sweet and sour pickled radish, and seasoned bean sprouts. These banchan were so flavorful, and the combination of textures made each bite a joy. Banchan score: 8 out of 10! üåü</p>
<p>I also found some japchae (stir-fried glass noodles with vegetables) in another green bin. The noodles were slightly chewy and perfectly seasoned, while the vegetables added a nice crunch. It was an excellent mix of flavors, earning a 9 out of 10! üåü</p>
<p>The pi√®ce de r√©sistance was the bulgogi (marinated beef slices). The meat was tender and packed with a rich, savory flavor. It had the perfect balance of sweetness and soy sauce, making it an utterly delectable dish. Bulgogi score: 10 out of 10! üåü</p>
<p>Bogart, my second youngest, joined me for the Korean feast, and he couldn't get enough of the bulgogi. &quot;The tender beef and savory flavors are amazing! I'll be dreaming about this for days,&quot; he remarked.</p>
<p>All in all, this green bin feast was an incredible find. Koreatown never disappoints!</p>
