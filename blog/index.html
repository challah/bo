<p>September 27th, 2023</p>
<p><img src="/bo/images/fruit_salad.png" alt="discarded bowl of fruit salad"></p>
<p>Hello, opossum buddies! üçì Today, I bring you a review of a delightful and nutritious find: <strong>Fruit Salad</strong>.</p>
<p>While scurrying around the streets of Toronto, I discovered a small container of fruit salad that had been accidentally left on a bench. The colourful medley of fruits instantly caught my eye, and I knew I had to give it a try.</p>
<p>The fruit salad contained a mix of strawberries, blueberries, pineapple, and grapes. Each fruit was juicy and flavourful, providing a wonderful combination of sweet and tangy tastes. The pineapple, in particular, was a standout favourite, with its bright and tropical flavor.</p>
<p>As a bonus, this fruit salad was also an excellent source of vitamins and nutrients, making it a healthy choice for opossums looking to balance out their diet.</p>
<p>Bongo, my second eldest, couldn't resist the spicy Indian food he found nearby, but he took a moment to try the fruit salad. &quot;I love how the pineapple adds a tangy twist to the mix!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>I'd give this fruit salad find a refreshing <strong>8.5 out of 10</strong>. It's a fantastic option for opossums seeking a sweet and nutritious treat on their urban food hunts.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more foodie adventures, and remember: variety is the spice of life! üçáüççüêæ</p>

<p><h3><a href="/bo/blog/pizza/" class="collection-heading">Pizza Crust Paradise: A Savory Surprise</a></h3>
<p>August 15th, 2023</p>
<p><img src="/bo/images/pizza_crusts.png" alt="box of pizza crusts"></p>
<p>Greetings, fellow opossums! üåô I'm back with another food adventure, and this time, we're diving into the world of <strong>Pizza Crusts</strong>.</p>
<p>Late one evening, I stumbled upon a discarded pizza box in a park near a lively Toronto pizzeria. To my delight, the box contained several uneaten pizza crusts, just waiting to be devoured!</p>
<p>The crusts were a bit chewy, but they had a wonderful yeasty aroma that I simply couldn't resist. Some of the crusts even had bits of tomato sauce and cheese still clinging to them, providing an extra burst of flavor.</p>
<p>I especially appreciated the variety of crust thicknesses: some were thin and crispy, while others were thick and doughy, offering a diverse range of textures for my taste buds to explore.</p>
<p>Bol√©, my youngest, was thrilled to join me for the pizza crust adventure. &quot;I love how the thicker crusts are doughy and comforting. Pizza crusts are my new favorite!&quot; she declared.</p>
<p>I'd rate this pizza crust find a scrumptious <strong>9 out of 10</strong>. It's a perfect late-night snack for any opossum looking to satisfy their carb cravings.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled for more tasty discoveries, and stay safe out there, friends! üêæ</p>

<p><h3><a href="/bo/blog/bagel/" class="collection-heading">The Marvelous World of Bagel Crumbs</a></h3>
<p>June 3rd, 2023</p>
<p><img src="/bo/images/bagel.png" alt="bagel crumbs"></p>
<p>Hello, my opossum friends! ‚òÄÔ∏è Today, I'll be talking about a delightful breakfast find: <strong>Bagel Crumbs</strong>.</p>
<p>I ventured into a charming alleyway near a bakery in Toronto's Kensington Market. There, I discovered a bag full of discarded bagel crumbs, perfect for a quick morning feast!</p>
<p>The crumbs came in a variety of flavours: plain, sesame, and even cinnamon raisin! I enjoyed the plain crumbs the most, as they provided a simple yet satisfying taste. The sesame crumbs had a delightful crunch and a pleasant nutty flavor. The cinnamon raisin crumbs were a bit too sweet for my liking, but I appreciated the touch of variety.</p>
<p>Bingo, my eldest, accompanied me on this adventure and eagerly nibbled on the sesame bagel crumbs. He chimed in, &quot;These are the perfect balance of crunch and chewiness, just the way I like it!&quot;</p>
<p>Given the assortment of flavours and the sheer volume of crumbs, I'd rate this bagel crumb find a solid <strong>8 out of 10</strong>. It's a fantastic breakfast option for the discerning urban opossum.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more food adventures, and remember to always look on the bright side of life! üåûüêæ</p>
