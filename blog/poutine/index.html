        <h2>Late-Night Poutine: A Garbage Can Delight</h2>
        
<img src="/bo/images/poutine.png" alt="poutine in a dark alleyway">
<p>Hey fellow opossums! üåô It's your favorite nocturnal foodie here, sharing my thoughts on a popular late-night snack in Toronto: <strong>Poutine</strong>.</p>
<p>Just the other night, I happened upon an open garbage can behind a bustling downtown restaurant. To my delight, I found some leftover poutine, a Canadian dish made of fries, cheese curds, and delicious gravy.</p>
<p>The fries were a bit soggy, but that's how I like 'em. The cheese curds were still fresh, providing that satisfying squeaky texture we all know and love. The gravy was a bit cold but had a rich flavor that brought the whole dish together.</p>
<p>Overall, I'd give this late-night garbage can poutine a solid <strong>7 out of 10</strong>. It's a scrumptious snack for any urban opossum on the go. Just remember to wash your paws after indulging in this savory treat!</p>
<p>Until next time, stay safe and happy foraging! üêæ</p>
