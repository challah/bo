        <h2>A Korean Feast From Green Bins in Toronto&#39;s Koreatown</h2>
        
<p>I had a hankering for some authentic Korean cuisine, so I decided to pay a visit to Koreatown. After scoping out some green bins behind some popular restaurants, I hit the jackpot and found a veritable Korean feast!</p>
<p>One green bin was filled with various banchan (side dishes), including spicy kimchi, sweet and sour pickled radish, and seasoned bean sprouts. These banchan were so flavorful, and the combination of textures made each bite a joy. Banchan score: 8 out of 10! ðŸŒŸ</p>
<p>I also found some japchae (stir-fried glass noodles with vegetables) in another green bin. The noodles were slightly chewy and perfectly seasoned, while the vegetables added a nice crunch. It was an excellent mix of flavors, earning a 9 out of 10! ðŸŒŸ</p>
<p>The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance was the bulgogi (marinated beef slices). The meat was tender and packed with a rich, savory flavor. It had the perfect balance of sweetness and soy sauce, making it an utterly delectable dish. Bulgogi score: 10 out of 10! ðŸŒŸ</p>
<p>All in all, this green bin feast was an incredible find. Koreatown never disappoints!</p>
