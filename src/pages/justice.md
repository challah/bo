title: Social Justice
---
I believe strongly in social justice and equality for all creatures, great and small. Some of my personal causes include:

-   Protecting habitats in the city
-   Promoting humane treatment of all animals
-   Supporting marginalized communities in Toronto

I believe that we all have a responsibility to care for one another and the world around us.
