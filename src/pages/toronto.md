title: Toronto

As a city opossum, I love exploring all the nooks and crannies of Toronto. Some of my favourite places to hang out include:

-   The Toronto Islands
-   High Park
-   The Don Valley
-   The Leslie Spit

These places are great for foraging for food, exploring new terrain, and enjoying the natural beauty of the city.
