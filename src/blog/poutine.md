Hey fellow opossums! üåô It's your favourite nocturnal foodie here, sharing my thoughts on a popular late-night snack in Toronto: **Poutine**.

Just the other night, I happened upon an open garbage can behind a bustling downtown restaurant. To my delight, I found some leftover poutine, a Canadian dish made of fries, cheese curds, and delicious gravy.

The fries were a bit soggy, but that's how I like 'em. The cheese curds were still fresh, providing that satisfying squeaky texture we all know and love. The gravy was a bit cold but had a rich flavour that brought the whole dish together.

Overall, I'd give this late-night garbage can poutine a solid **7 out of 10**. It's a scrumptious snack for any urban opossum on the go. Just remember to wash your paws after indulging in this savory treat!

All my children joined me to share the delicious find. They all had different opinions on the dish, but they agreed that the cheese curds were the star of the show.

Until next time, stay safe and happy foraging! üêæ
