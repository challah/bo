Hey fellow opossums! 🌙 It's your favorite nocturnal foodie here, sharing my thoughts on a popular late-night snack in Toronto: **Poutine**.

Just the other night, I happened upon an open garbage can behind a bustling downtown restaurant. To my delight, I found some leftover poutine, a Canadian dish made of fries, cheese curds, and delicious gravy.

The fries were a bit soggy, but that's how I like 'em. The cheese curds were still fresh, providing that satisfying squeaky texture we all know and love. The gravy was a bit cold but had a rich flavor that brought the whole dish together.

Overall, I'd give this late-night garbage can poutine a solid **7 out of 10**. It's a scrumptious snack for any urban opossum on the go. Just remember to wash your paws after indulging in this savory treat!

Until next time, stay safe and happy foraging! 🐾
