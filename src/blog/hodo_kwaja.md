Opossums, gather around because I have discovered the tastiest treats in Toronto's Koreatown! Today, I have some exciting news to share with you all. I've stumbled upon some scrumptious leftovers in Christie Pits, right from the legendary Hodo Kwaja bakery in Toronto's Koreatown!

**Walnut Cakes** First up, I tried their famous walnut cakes. These small, round pastries are filled with sweet red bean paste and a walnut piece. The cakes are soft, warm, and have a lovely aroma. The red bean paste is just the right level of sweetness, and the walnut adds a satisfying crunch. I'll give these walnut cakes a solid 9 out of 10! ðŸŒŸ

**Hotteok** Next, I tried their hotteok, a Korean-style pancake filled with brown sugar, honey, and crushed peanuts. The hotteok is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, with a gooey, sweet filling. It's the perfect blend of textures! The sweetness of the brown sugar and honey contrasts nicely with the savory pancake, making for a mouth-watering experience. Hotteok gets a 10 out of 10 from me! ðŸŒŸ

I am truly grateful for these delightful leftover treasures from Hodo Kwaja. Stay tuned for more of my culinary escapades!
