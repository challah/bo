Hello, my opossum friends! ☀️ Today, I'll be talking about a delightful breakfast find: **Bagel Crumbs**.

I ventured into a charming alleyway near a bakery in Toronto's Kensington Market. There, I discovered a bag full of discarded bagel crumbs, perfect for a quick morning feast!

The crumbs came in a variety of flavours: plain, sesame, and even cinnamon raisin! I enjoyed the plain crumbs the most, as they provided a simple yet satisfying taste. The sesame crumbs had a delightful crunch and a pleasant nutty flavor. The cinnamon raisin crumbs were a bit too sweet for my liking, but I appreciated the touch of variety.

Bingo, my eldest, accompanied me on this adventure and eagerly nibbled on the sesame bagel crumbs. He chimed in, "These are the perfect balance of crunch and chewiness, just the way I like it!"

Given the assortment of flavours and the sheer volume of crumbs, I'd rate this bagel crumb find a solid **8 out of 10**. It's a fantastic breakfast option for the discerning urban opossum.

Stay tuned for more food adventures, and remember to always look on the bright side of life! 🌞🐾
