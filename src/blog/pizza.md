Greetings, fellow opossums! 🌙 I'm back with another food adventure, and this time, we're diving into the world of **Pizza Crusts**.

Late one evening, I stumbled upon a discarded pizza box in a park near a lively Toronto pizzeria. To my delight, the box contained several uneaten pizza crusts, just waiting to be devoured!

The crusts were a bit chewy, but they had a wonderful yeasty aroma that I simply couldn't resist. Some of the crusts even had bits of tomato sauce and cheese still clinging to them, providing an extra burst of flavor.

I especially appreciated the variety of crust thicknesses: some were thin and crispy, while others were thick and doughy, offering a diverse range of textures for my taste buds to explore.

I'd rate this pizza crust find a scrumptious **9 out of 10**. It's a perfect late-night snack for any opossum looking to satisfy their carb cravings. 

Keep your eyes peeled for more tasty discoveries, and stay safe out there, friends! 🐾
