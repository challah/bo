        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        
<p>Hello, fellow opossums and opossum enthusiasts! I've been receiving a lot of questions about opossum life, and I thought it would be fun to create an FAQ to help everyone get to know me and my fellow opossums better. So, let's dive right in!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are opossums aggressive?</strong> A: Contrary to popular belief, opossums are not aggressive. We are generally shy, solitary creatures who prefer to avoid confrontation. If we feel threatened, we might hiss or show our teeth, but we're more likely to play dead (a.k.a. &quot;playing possum&quot;) to deter predators.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do opossums eat?</strong> A: Opossums are opportunistic omnivores, which means we'll eat just about anything! I, for one, adore food and love trying new things. My diet includes fruits, vegetables, insects, small animals, and even trash from green bins. But remember, not all opossums are as adventurous as me when it comes to food.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do opossums help the environment?</strong> A: Opossums play a crucial role in controlling insect and rodent populations. We also help keep the environment clean by eating rotting fruit and other organic matter. Plus, we have a strong immune system, which makes us resistant to many diseases that can affect other animals, such as rabies.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do opossums care for their babies?</strong> A: Opossum mothers are very devoted! After giving birth, the tiny, underdeveloped babies crawl into their mother's pouch to continue growing. Once they're big enough, they'll cling onto their mother's back as she travels in search of food. As a proud opossum mom, I can confirm that it's a fantastic bonding experience!</p>
<p><strong>Fun Fact: Prehensile Tail</strong> Did you know that opossums have a prehensile tail? It's true! Our tails can grasp and hold onto objects, like tree branches. While we don't use our tails to hang upside down (that's a myth), they do help us with balance and climbing.</p>
<p><strong>Fun Fact: Marsupial Marvel</strong> Opossums are North America's only native marsupial. That's right! Like kangaroos and koalas, opossums have a pouch for carrying and nurturing their babies. We're unique little creatures, indeed!</p>
<p>I hope this FAQ helps clear up some misconceptions and sheds light on the fascinating world of opossums. If you have more questions, feel free to ask! I'm always here to chat about opossum life in Toronto.</p>
